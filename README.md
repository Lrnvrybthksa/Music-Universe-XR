# Music-Universe-XR
to play and make music in a XR setting

play in 3D studios, stages, with friends and other musicians
collaborate in XR

play new and different 3D instruments, no more keyboard/MIDI only!
drums, woodwinds, strings, keys etc...

create visual effects and creative settings/environments to complement music 
while in studio or on stage to create the right mood ex. nature, fantasy 

share and host XR live concerts/streams 

discover new artists, musicians, users 

create new instruments and sound visual effects 
(add visual 3d objects that make certain sounds) 
to be able to visualize the music 

play 3d instruments, real, electronic and custom instruments

can use any DAW you connect to in the app

invite others to watch you jam, play, practice and create 

private/public spaces 

free app, free-to-play, open code 

access through website or on VR app stores

also spaces to hangout alone/with others and listen to music 
with other music apps integrated like spotify, YT music, amazon music etc...

buy and tip artists/musicians, buy their VR merchandise etc... 

also watch live IRL concerts, any venue can host their live concerts 
instead of them managing their own software, they just need the cameras
they can add and customize in app cameras, views, UI etc..

templates for different event hosting, for a more real 3d experience 
similar to the holographic repo but in VR 
ex. make a stage almost lifelike in VR from the use of 
various cameras in different locations in the event, instead of using 
one main camera, maybe even with a drone camera option too
